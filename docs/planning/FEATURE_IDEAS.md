### Unique Feature Ideas to Differentiate

- Smart watchlists and bundles: users can track sets (e.g., PC build) with aggregate “best total price” and historical savings.
- Price drop forecasting: model price trends with time-series to predict optimal buy windows and notify “buy now” vs “wait.”
- Deal quality scoring: score listings using anomaly detection (price vs historical mean, seller reputation, shipping).
- Community signals: voting and comments on deals, with anti-spam heuristics.
- Coupon/stacking assistant: auto-detect coupons, card perks, store promos, and stack for the best checkout price.
- Region and currency arbitrage: compare across regions, factor in duties/shipping, and convert currencies with FX buffer.
- Browser extension: inline price history and alerts on retailer pages; one-click “add to watchlist.”
- API marketplace mode: public endpoints for developers with tiered rate limits and analytics.
