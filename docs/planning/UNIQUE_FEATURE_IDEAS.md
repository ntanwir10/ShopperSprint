### Unique feature ideas to differentiate

- Smart watchlists and bundles: users can track sets (e.g., PC build) with aggregate “best total price” and historical savings across retailers.
- Price drop forecasting: time-series modeling to predict optimal buy windows; notify “buy now” vs “wait.”
- Deal quality scoring: anomaly detection vs historical mean, seller reputation, shipping, return policy; expose a score badge.
- Community signals: voting and comments on deals, with anti-spam heuristics and contributor reputation.
- Coupon/stacking assistant: auto-detect coupons, card perks, and promos; simulate stacked checkout price.
- Region and currency arbitrage: compare cross-border prices, duties/shipping estimates, FX buffer; suggest optimal region.
- Browser extension: inline price history and alert creation on retailer pages; one-click “add to watchlist.”
- API marketplace mode: public endpoints for developers with tiered rate limits, API keys, and analytics.
