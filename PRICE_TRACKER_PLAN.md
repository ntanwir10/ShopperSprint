# Comprehensive Project Plan: Product Price Tracker

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Project Summary

Product Price Tracker is a full-stack web application that enables users to search for products across multiple online sources and compare prices in real-time. The application scrapes and aggregates product information from various e-commerce sites, providing users with comprehensive price comparisons, sorting capabilities, and real-time price updates. The system categorizes sources into popular retailers and alternative sources while ensuring data validity and accuracy.

### 1.2. Goals and Objectives

* To provide a centralized platform for users to find the best prices for products online
* To deliver a fast, accurate, and user-friendly experience across all devices
* To build a scalable and maintainable application with comprehensive error handling
* To implement an advertisement system for revenue generation
* To create a robust web scraping infrastructure that respects rate limits and handles failures gracefully

### 1.3. Technology Stack

* **Frontend:**
  * **Framework:** React with TypeScript
  * **Build Tool:** Vite
  * **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
  * **State Management:** React hooks with local and global state
* **Backend:**
  * **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
  * **Caching:** Redis for search results and session data
  * **Web Scraping:** Puppeteer for dynamic content, Cheerio for static HTML parsing
  * **Queue System:** Bull Queue with Redis for managing scraping jobs

  * **Containerization:** Docker containers
  * **Frontend:** Vercel (planned)
  * **Backend:** AWS or Heroku (planned)

### 1.4. Core Reasons We Need a Database

#### **Product Data Persistence**

* **Product Information**: Store product names, categories, specifications
* **Price History**: Track price changes over time to show trends
* **Product Matching**: Match products across different sources (Amazon, Walmart, etc.)

#### **Search Results Caching & Storage**

* **Search Queries**: Store what users searched for
* **Results History**: Keep track of previous search results
* **Performance**: Avoid re-scraping the same data repeatedly

#### **Source Management**

* **E-commerce Sources**: Store configuration for different websites we scrape
* **Rate Limiting**: Track how often we've scraped each source
* **Source Health**: Monitor which sources are working/failing

#### **User Experience Features**

* **Recent Searches**: Show users their search history
* **Favorites**: Let users save products they're tracking
* **Price Alerts**: Store user preferences for price drop notifications

#### **Business Intelligence**

* **Popular Products**: Track what users search for most
* **Source Performance**: Analyze which retailers have the best prices
* **Advertisement Data**: Store ad performance metrics
